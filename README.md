# Substrate and Polkadot hacker kit ðŸ’» ðŸ› 

## Welcome

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is made for hackathon participants looking to work on some Substrate / Polkadot challenges for the [Chainlink Hackathon 2022](https://chainlinkspring2022.devpost.com/).

What's what?

* [Substrate](substrate.io) is a framework that makes it easy to create custom blockchains and runtime logic from scratch.
* [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) is an upgradable blockchain built with Substrate, designed to secure other chains connected to it and provide interoperability.
* [ink!](https://paritytech.github.io/ink-docs/) is a special language designed to make it easy to write Wasm smart contracts for Substrate chains.

ðŸ”Ž Are you looking for some challenges to work on? Head over to the [challenges page](./challenges/README.md).

ðŸ“š Are you new to Substrate and Polkadot? Brush up your knowledge by [going through these useful resources](#resources).

**Note:** Use the challenge ideas as guidance for the types of projects we'd like to see built. And if one of our ideas is something you'd like to do, go for it! 
The intention is that these challenge ideas inspire you to work on prize-winning submissions that you will enjoy working on.
